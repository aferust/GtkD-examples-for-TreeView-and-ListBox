# GtkD examples for TreeView and ListBox
An example project that uses sqlite and treeview/listbox synchronizing data between the widgets and database. I could not find so many examples of handling liststore, treeview events so I decided to make an example project.

- Please note that I did not implement some important concepts such as exception handling to keep things simple
- Due to some copy-paste operations from my Vala code, I could not be consistent in terms of snake/camel case, sorry.
